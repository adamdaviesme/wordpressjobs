### To view

-   Download branch
-   Run 'npm install'
-   Install composer packages
-   Run a vite build 'npm run build'
-   Will need .env amending to point to empty database
-   Run php artisan serve or run via Valet
-   There are database seeders for dummy data so you can run 'php artisan migrate:fresh --seed' to see some demo jobs etc

Thank you
